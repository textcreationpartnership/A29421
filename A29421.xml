            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Brief and True Account of the notorious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and wicked Practices of that Grand Impoſtor <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO Trace this impious Impoſtor from his Original, who ever takes pains but to go into <hi>Cloak Lane,</hi> will there be informed by the Generallity of the Inhabitants, that this <hi>Lodowick Muggleton</hi> was at firſt no other than a factious Journiman-<hi>Taylor,</hi> whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances being too large for the compitent allowance of about 10 <hi>s. p.</hi> week, began in the year 1651. to conſult with one <hi>John Reeve</hi> (a brother both in Trade and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) how they might betake them to ſome more profitable imployment, whoſe larded Incomes might more kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their Lukury; to this end they made ſome ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and progreſs into all ſorts of <hi>Hereſies</hi> (as he has ſince confeſt to <hi>J. C.</hi> and others) but finding thoſe Chairs already taken up, they reſolv'd to be beholding to no body, but to contract ſuch a competent meaſure of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and impiety, as ſhould inable them to ſtifle all the oppoſitions of Religion, or Conſcience, and ſet up for themſelves. And that which gave them no ſmall incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement hereunto was the wonderful ſucceſs and almoſt infinite Riches, two precedent impoſtors <hi>John Roubins</hi> and <hi>Joh. Tauny,</hi> had lately gained by the ſame damnable practice. The proſperity of theſe two rendred the private conditions of <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Muggleton</hi> more unſufferable; ſo that the former being the more impudent, and having with ſome curioſity peruſed the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> and found to his extreem ſorrow that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had never ſo much as dreampt of him throughout the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51815:3"/> whole Book, he reſolves by the help of a feigned Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm or pretended Revelation, to force in the minds of Liſtening Ignorants, whoſe Gaping curioſity lay always open for the reception of any Novelty, a certain belief of a ſtrange <hi>inſpiration,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion</hi> then delivered unto him, whereby (forſooth) he not only pretends a Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Mankind but aſſumes, a power to paſs (upon the leaſt contradiction of his wicked principles) a ſentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Condemnation, even upon the bleſſed Angels themſelves: as is affirm'd he hath authority to do, in a book of <hi>Muggletons,</hi> called the <hi>Quakers Neck broke,</hi> pag. 20.</p>
            <p>To exact this neceſſary Credulity from his Gazing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, he calls one Evening of <hi>Muggleton</hi> to go with him to the Tavern, from whence after they had Gorged their Guts with an exceſs of Wine, and Victuals, they reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forthwith to go Chew the Cud both of their diſcourſe and Viends upon their Pillows, whereon <hi>Reeve</hi> had not long laid his ſhallow skul, but whether caus'd by fumes a riſing from an undiſgeſted Supper, or the important preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his deſigned greatneſs, I know not, but up he gets, runs to <hi>Muggleton,</hi> tells him as <hi>Muggleton</hi> does us in his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical interpretation of the 11. chap. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> pag. 158. <hi>That God ſpake in the night unto him, and told him that he had given him more underſtanding in the Scriptures than all other men in the World. That he had put the two edged ſword in his mouth,</hi> and in the next words <hi>following,</hi> and I have <hi>Choſen thee</hi> Lodowick Muggleton <hi>to be thy mouth: That I have given you power both to bleſs and curſe, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever either of you ſhall bleſs or curſe it ſhall be in the power of no Spirit nor Angel,</hi> No nor as Mugleton ſays in page 40 <hi>in the Almighties himſelf to revoke from eternal Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This falacy being blown about by ſome of their graceleſs Adherents, the greedy Vulgarity miſtake
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51815:3"/> it for a Verity, and to ſhew their obedience, as well as Credulity, relinquiſh their former principles as eroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to liſt themſelves under the deſtructive Banners of of his <hi>forgeries</hi> and impoſtures.</p>
            <p>The promiſing ſuperficies of this black deſign at firſt ſeem'd to recompence the paines of theſe ſpiritual <hi>Engineers</hi> with a favourable progreſſion, but Heaven who could no longer forbear to puniſh their impieties, ſufficiently teſtified its diſpleaſure in Beckoning <hi>Reeve,</hi> to give an account in the other World of thoſe Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable principles, wherewith he had tainted the minds, if not Ruin'd the Souls of divers in this; which one would have thought might have put a ſtop at leaſt to the proceedings of this <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> who now double Gilded with Braſs, pretended alſo to have had left him by <hi>Reeve</hi> a double portion both of ſpirit, power, and commiſſion; inlarging his Authority even beyond the prerogative of any deceaſed <hi>Saint, Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as will by a Letter he ſent <hi>R. Franſworth,</hi> and the ſaid Book of his, entitled the <hi>Quakers Neck-broken,</hi> moſt obviouſly appear. In the <hi>Letter</hi> page 43. he writes thus; ſpeaking of the power he pretends God has given him to bleſs, curſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>Neither (ſays he) will God give this power to any after me, neither can any man come to the aſſurance of the favour of God now in theſe days but in believing that God gave this power to <hi>John Reeve</hi> and my ſelf. For there is no coming to know God or ſee God, but by the faith in this commiſſion of the ſpirit, for I having the Keys of Heaven and Hell, none can get into Heaven unleſs the witneſs of this ſpirit doth open the Gate.</q> 
               <hi>Again
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51815:4"/> in his Quakers Neck-broken,</hi> page. 20. <hi>He ſay.</hi> 
               <q>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any man know the Scriptures, neither can any man interpret them truly but my ſelf, <hi>and in the ſame page he goes on.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>God hath put the two edged ſword into my mouth, that whoſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver I pronounce curſed, is curſed to Eternity. For I do not only ſay let him be accurſed, but I have power to curſe men or Angels to Eternity.</q> And in Page 28. Speaking of his ſpiritual knowledg, how he has reſolved all ſorts of queſtions in Divinity, theſe are his words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay, ſome have gone ſo far as to ask who made God, and I have given anſwer to that alſo.</hi> Again in his letter to <hi>S.H.</hi> and <hi>W.S.</hi> who in a former letter condemned him for Curſing, to which <hi>Muggleton</hi> anſwers, page 17. <hi>As for my mouth being full of curſing, that is my commiſſion.</hi> Again page. 18. <q>Full of his Curſing I confeſs my mouth is, and I do rejoice in it too, I know that God is well pleaſed in the damnation of thoſe I have curſed, and I am wonderous well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in giving Judgment upon them acccording to the Tenelt of my condition.</q> In fine <hi>Reader,</hi> I am a weary, and it makes my hair ſtand an end to Rake thus in the Naucious Dunghil of his horrid <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> his whole <hi>Volume</hi> is nothing but a promiſcuous compoſition of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, Deluſion,</hi> irreligion and <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> Himſelf a perſon who for this 20 years and upwards has ſhaken hands with <hi>Morality, Diſcretion,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> who for that inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pelf, Honor and reſpect, he dayly receives from the hands of his poor deluded, and without ſudden conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I fear miſerable Diſciples, willingly ſurrenders his intereſt in Heaven; and as if he had too advantagious an exchange, throws the wretched Souls of his friends and acquaintance into the Bargain</p>
            <p>I would earneſtly deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> if he be not yet eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in opinion, to endeavour to ſeek a ſettlement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, firſt by his prayers to almighty God to that purpoſe, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51815:4"/> after by the healing advice of ſome learned Divine, from whom he will certainly find more ſollid ſatisfaction than he can ever expect from theſe <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Empricks</hi> in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; who handle the ſoul, as others do their body, not ſo much for the patients good, as their own Intereſt. Who if they can make a ſeaſonable approach to a Death bed, &amp; there by a pretended commiſſion wheedle the departing Diſciple into a belief that they have received the Keys of Heaven; Can turn who they will into everlaſting Joys, and hurry who they pleaſe into eternal Bliſs; if by the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rhetoricks of a Gray head, comely Viſage, demure Countenance, and plauſible tongue, he can but once perſwade them to fall out with the World, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render theſe temporial bleſſings, in hopes of thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ones (of which theſe ſort of men make ſuch large promiſes) there is none of them but will gladly part with, all their pretended <hi>Keys</hi> of Heaven, for one real one which unloks to a hundred a year upon <hi>Earth,</hi> or that would ſcruple to give a man a <hi>note of their hands</hi> for the ſecuring his eternal bliſs, provided the other would requite him with a conſiderabled <hi>Leaſe,</hi> to beſtow among his <hi>ſanctified children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Muggleton</hi> and his Brethren have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any of theſe ſoul feeling bleſſings, I leave it to his and their conſciences, and did I know it to be true I ſhould ſcarcely put my ſelf to the charges of a Tear to bemoan the cheat, for indeed, who can ſeriouſly pitty thoſe perſons who having been Educated in the wholſome principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when he ſhall ſee them like Baſtards and not Sons, forſake thoſe Teats whereout they often have, and ſtill might, ſuck ſuch nouriſhing milk; when he beholds them runing after a nonſenſical <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> frought up with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51815:5"/> but intereſt and Imdudence; a kidnapper of Souls, who would ſell them for leſs mony to the <hi>Devil,</hi> than the other do Children to <hi>Barbados;</hi> a fellow who if a man can find any connextion in his writings, it runs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Diamiter to thoſe of the Holy Scriptures, a wretch ſo arragant, that he dares to pretend a greater power than ever was delivered to any of the Prophets or Apoſtles, that denies both the real exiſtance and abſolute, and by all undoubted ubiquity of his Creator, pag. 34. pag. 23. That Nulls the Vallidity of ſeveral Texts of Scripture, and particularly <hi>denies Solomon to be endued with the Spirit of God, when he writ the Book of Proverbs.</hi> And in ſhort is ſo rediculous both in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and Philoſophy, as to define God to be a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real aſſence exactly in the ſhape of man, that his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is confin'd within the narrow circuit of the upper Heavens only. And laſtly which is enough to give any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Reader a ſurfeit both of him and his Doctrine, he affirms his writings are in themſelves more excellent, and ought to be by all men more reſpected and regarded than the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now Reader after thou haſt known all this of <hi>Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton,</hi> &amp; yet wilt not be perſwaded, but will adher to his Damnable principles, wert thou thereby cheated into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other loſs than that of thy eternal Soul it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe my deriſion than Pitty: but ſince thereby thou art to forego thy everlaſting proſperity, I cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee with extream compaſſion.</p>

Licenſed according to Order. <hi>Quarto,</hi> containing ſix Pages, printed at <hi>London</hi> for <hi>B. H.</hi> in 1676.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LOdowick Muggleton</hi> was born of poor, though honeſt Parents, living at <hi>Chippenham,</hi> within fifteen Miles of <hi>Briſtol:</hi> His Relations having but little Means, and a great Charge of Children to maintain, they were forced to ſend their Daughters to wait on their neighbouring Gentry, and to place their Sons to ſuch Trades as coſt little Binding them Apprentices; but, amongſt all the reſt of thoſe of this worſhipful Brood, they were bleſſed withal, they might have obſerved, even in his cunicular Days, in this <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> an obſtinate, diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and oppoſive Spirit; which made them deſirous to ſettle him at ſome Diſtance from them, and alſo to bind him to ſuch a Trade, and Maſter, as might curb him from that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which the Moroſeneſs of his coarſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture extorted from his too indulgent Parents: By which Means, as ſoon as he had made ſome ſmall Inſpection into his Accidence, without any other Accompliſhment, beſides a little Writing and Caſting of Accompts, he was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to <hi>London,</hi> and there bound Apprentice to one of the croſs-legged Order, but of an indifferent Reputation in the Place where he lived, though by Trade a Taylor. We will paſs over the Parentheſis of his Youth in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, therein being nothing but uſual Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries, which generally recommend to our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ſomething remarkable, when the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Extravagancies ſhall be ſeaſoned with Age.</p>
            <p>When the Time of his Apprenticeſhip grew near its Expiration, ſo that he was admitted more Liberty, than formerly was granted him, he was obſerved to be a great Haunter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles; inſomuch that there could not a diſſenting Nonconformiſt diffuſe his Sedition in any obſcure Corner of the City, but this <hi>Lodowick Muggleton</hi> would have a Part of it; by which Means, continuing in the ſame idle Curioſity, and taking great Obſervation on that unknown Gain, many of that canting Tribe got by their deluded Auditors, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf a certain and conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be got by the ſame Means, by which he had obſerved many of thoſe great Pretenders gull both himſelf and others: For a rooked Conventicler, like a bankrupt Gameſter, having, for ſome Time, been cullied out of his Money, learns the Trick, ſets up Hector, and trades for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> by ſliding out of one Religion into another, ſo diſſatisfy his Judgment, and run himſelf from the ſolid Baſis of his firſt Principles; firſt degenerating, from the orthodox Tenets of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to <hi>Presbytery;</hi> from thence to <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;</hi> thence to <hi>Anabaptiſm;</hi> thence to <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm;</hi> and, laſtly, to no Religion at all.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51815:6"/>
            <p>When Men have, thus, once fooled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of Religion and a good Conſcience, it is no Wonder, that their ſecular Intereſts draw them into all Sorts of Impiety and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, as it has done this <hi>Lodowick Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> who, though, in himſelf, a poor, ſilly, deſpicable Creature, yet had the Confidence to think he had Parts enough to wheedle a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſilly, credulous Proſelytes out of their Souls and Eſtates: And, indeed, he has had ſuch admirable Succeſs in that wicked Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, that, tho' we cannot abſolutely conclude, that he has cheated them of the firſt; yet we can prove, if Occaſion were, that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded them of the latter; as has been often told him, ſince the firſt Day of his Stan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ng in the Pillory.</p>
            <p>It has been told already, how this impious Impoſtor lays Claim to a counterfeit Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby he has infected the Truths of many honeſt, ignorant People, with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Power, that was delivered to him by as infamous a Blaſphemer as himſelf, <hi>John Reeve;</hi> who, as he formerly rivalled <hi>Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in Impiety, had he been yet living, ſhould certainly have clubbed with him in his deſerved Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>It is about twenty-one Years, ſince this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Creature began his Impoſtures; who, knowing himſelf as defective of Reaſon, as of Religion, made it one of the grand Maxims of his Policy, That his Proſelytes ſhould be fully perſuaded, contrary to all Senſe, or Probability. Reaſon was that great Beaſt, ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and, conſequently, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted withal, as to the Examining of any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Point in Religion; whereby he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured both himſelf, and his ſhallow Diſciples, from all thoſe frequent Diſputations and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which, otherwiſe, muſt neceſſarily have diverted them from adhering to his damnable, impious, and irrational Tenets; which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omit, as being too unſufferably profane for the modeſt Ear of any ſober, well-meaning <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we may judge a little of the Theorick by the Practick, I mean, of his Principles by his Practices, and of the Soundneſs of his Doctrine by thoſe Duties he held himſelf, and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, obliged to, in the Performance of it; which, indeed, were none at all; it being his uſual Cuſtom, when they met on the Sabbath-day, to entertain them with a Pig of their own Sow; I mean, with Wine, ſtrong Drink, or Victuals; which either they ſent in before-hand, or brought along with them; allowing them to be as licentious, as they pleaſed, in all Things that might gratify, or indulge their Senſes.</p>
            <p>A Friend of mine was, one <hi>Sunday,</hi> walking in the Fields; and, meeting there an old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of his, who was lately turned <hi>Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gletonian,</hi> with a young Baggage in his Hand, which, he did more than ſuſpect, was light, he could not forbear Expreſſing his Admiration, to this <hi>Muggletonian</hi> himſelf, in theſe, or ſuch-like Terms: <q>I cannot but wonder to ſee you, my old Neighbour, who have, for theſe many Years, buſied yourſelf in the Study of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and was, not long ſince, like to have gone mad, becauſe you knew not which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to ſtick to. I ſay, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee you Abroad, on the Sabbath-day, in this briſk Poſture; you are altered both in Countenance, Apparel, and Manners, ſo that I almoſt doubt, whom I ſpeak to. Ah, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Muggletonian,</hi> you know, Friend, how I have heretofore troubled myſelf about Religion indeed; inſomuch that it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt coſt me my Life, but all in vain, till about ſix Weeks ſince; at which Time I met with <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> who has put me into the eaſieſt Way to Heaven, that ever was invented; for he gives us Liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we do but believe in his Commiſſion, freely to launch into all thoſe Pleaſures, which others, leſs knowing, call Vices; and, after all, will aſſure us of eternal Salvation.</q> Behold, Reader, what a ſweet Religion here is like to be.</p>
            <p>But, as <hi>Muggleton</hi> was liberal in the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he gave his Adherents, ſo he was always careful to avoid the Prohibitions of the Law; he generally appointed his Bubbles to meet in the Fields, where he alſo permitted them to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour their Senſualities with any Recreation, not excepting Uncleanneſs itſelf; for which Profaning the Sabbath he was, in <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Time, committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he had like to have been ſo dealt withal then, that <hi>Tyburn</hi> had ſaved the Pillory this Trouble now: But that perfidious Uſurper, conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that <hi>Muggleton</hi> could not he a greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor in the Church, than he was in the State, upon the Conſideration of <hi>Fratres in malis,</hi> reſtored him to his Liberty.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, a little before <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Death, <hi>Muggleton,</hi> by continual Flatteries, had got into his Books, and, amongſt other Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:51815:6"/> him, had declared, that <hi>Oliver</hi> ſhould perform more wonderful Actions, than any he had yet atchieved, before he died. But, he happening to depart this Life, before he had done any Thing elſe that was remarkable, <hi>Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was demanded, Why his Prophecy proved not true? He anſwered very wiſely, and like himſelf, <hi>viz. That he was ſure</hi> Oliver <hi>would have performed them, had he lived long enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſince his Gracious Majeſty's Return, he has driven on a much more profitable theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Cheat, having aſſumed the Liberty not only of infuſing what Doctrine he pleaſed into the Minds of his ignorant deluded Followers, but writ ſeveral profane Books, which, to his great Advantage, he diſperſed among them; poiſoning their Minds thereby with a Hodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podge of rotten Tenets, whereby they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uncapable of reliſhing the more ſound, wholeſome, and undoubted Principles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with one Story more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Muggleton,</hi> and ſo leave him to the Cenſure of the ingenuous Reader. A timiſh Gentleman, accoutered with Sword and Peruke, hearing the Noiſe this Man cauſed in the Town, had a great Deſire to diſcourſe with him, whom he found alone in his Study; and, takin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Advantage of that Occaſion, he urged <hi>Muggle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſo far, that, knowing not what to ſay, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> falls to a ſolemn Curſing of the Gentleman who was ſo inraged thereat, that he drew hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sword, and ſwore he would run him through immediately, unleſs he recanted the Sentence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Damnation, which he had preſumptuouſly caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon him. <hi>Muggleton,</hi> perceiving, by the Gentleman's Looks, that he really intended what he threatened, did not only recant his Curſe, but pitifully intreated him whom he had curſed before; by which we may underſtand the Invalidity both of him, and his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Thus, whoever conſiders the Contents of <hi>Muggleton</hi>'s whole Life, will find it, <hi>in toto,</hi> nothing but a continued Cheat of above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one Years long; which, in the Cataſtrophe, he may behold worthily rewarded with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Puniſhment of a wooden Ruff, or Pillory; his grey Hairs gilded with Dirt and rotten Eggs; and, in fine, himſelf brought, by Reaſon of his own horrid and irreligious Actions, into the greateſt Scorn and Contempt imaginable, by all the Lovers of Piety, Diſcretion, or good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
